## Development

First you `npm install`

Then you `npm run dev`

Then you do some work.

When you are ready for prime time, you can just submit a PR to this repo and it will be deployed once it's accepted. 

If you want to build your own version, just run `npm run build` and then I'd recommend deploying with `now`.
